# UnitTestingHardwareAssignment



Repository for the Unit Testing assignment for SD6. The intend is to add an abstraction layer to hardware, to test a main system with mock and stub classes. 

Tests can be compiled and ran by opening the solution file in Visual studio, right clicking the Unit test project, and Clicking on "Run tests".

WIP: Adding a CI pipeline to automate these unit tests.
